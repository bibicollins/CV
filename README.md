I have recently completed a 16-week intensive programming bootcamp at Makers, I applied for the course because I had found a real interest in software and having graduated from the course, software development has in turn graduated from an interest into my absolute path. 


I have always had a love of learning across many subject matters, and it is predominantly for this reason I became engrossed in the world of programming, it is the combination of mathematics, language and creativity that I find fascinating, paired with the opportunity for growth of and within the field.

## Projects
| Project link | Description | Date started | Languages & Technologies | 
|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| :sun_with_face:[Array of Sunshine](https://github.com/bibicollins/array_of_sunshine) | The final project at makers academy, built in a group of 4 during the last 2 weeks of the course. We built an educational tool for beginner programmers wanting to sharpen up their array method knowledge in 3 programming languages (Javascript, Ruby and Python). The application is built with a react front-end and an express backend. Fully deployed on heroku here: https://hip-hip-array.herokuapp.com/ | Weeks 11 & 12 of Makers | React, Express, Heroku, Nodejs, Jest, Enzyme, Javascript, Ruby, Python | 
| :moneybag:[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/bibicollins/Bank_tech_test) | Simulating a professional level tech test using Ruby to create a simple bank account that can print a summary of transactions in the console. The main focus of this week was to demonstrate my learning so far, especially focusing on TDD, OOD and writing code that is easy to read & change.  | Week 10 of Makers | Ruby, Rspec, Simplecov | 
| :umbrella:[Thermostat](https://github.com/bibicollins/thermostat) |  Entering the world of Javascript by creating a front-end thermostat web application. The primary goal of this week was to first learn Javascript and continue to consolidate skills such as TDD within its implementation. This was also the first time using jQuery to build interactive functionality into a webpage.  | Week 5 of Makers | Javascript, Jasmine, Jquery | 
| :house:[Acebook](https://github.com/bibicollins/acebook-ruff-criminals) | Our first 2 week group project, designed to replicate a professional working environment, focusing heavily on using Agile process. | Weeks 8 & 9 of Makers | Ruby on Rails, Rspec, Capybara, Selenium and SimpleCov |


## Skills

  

#### Team work
I have always been a huge proponent of team work as it has been a central element in most of my work and life experience thus far, and I believe it is where I thrive. In our group projects 


#### Adaptability
Learning a foreign language has always been on my list, so I took my Spanish GCSE and moved to Bilbao in July 2016. Soon after I studied a TEFL course online and quickly got a job as an English teacher at an immersive language course despite having no previous experience of teaching. I had to adapt to the classroom teaching predominantly business professionals, whilst also adapting to a new place, culture and learning a new language. This showed to be useful at Makers as we were learning multiple different skills, styles of work and work practices all in a new environment and working closely with new people.
