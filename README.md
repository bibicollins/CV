I am currently studying on a 16 week intensive programming bootcamp - Makers Academy.
I have always had a love of learning across all subject matters, and it is predominantly for this reason I discovered and soon became engrossed in the world of programming, it is the combination of mathematics, language and creativity that I find fascinating, paired with the opportunity for growth of and within the field.

## Skills

#### Adaptability
In July 2016 I moved to Spain to learn Spanish, naturally I had to work to earn my keep, so I studied a TEFL course and quickly got a job as an English teacher at an immersive language course. Despite having no previous experience of teaching I quickly had to adapt to the classroom whilst teaching predominantly business professionals in an intensive course.

#### Team work
I have always been a huge proponent of team work as it has been a central element in most of my work and life experience thus far. I was always part of sports teams at school, which I believe gives a good foundation for teamwork skills and further developed my teamwork skills working in the hospitality sector after school.
