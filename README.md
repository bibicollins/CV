I have recently finished a 16 week intensive programming bootcamp - [Makers](https://makers.tech/) it was during this course I was introduced to such concepts as Agile process, TDD
I have always had a love of learning across all subject matters, and it is predominantly for this reason I discovered and soon became engrossed in the world of programming, it is the combination of mathematics, language and creativity that I find fascinating, paired with the opportunity for growth of and within the field.

## Projects
| Project link | Description | Date started | Languages & Technologies |

| :sun_with_face:[Array of Sunshine](https://github.com/bibicollins/array_of_sunshine) | The final project at makers academy, built in a group of 4 during the last 2 weeks of the course. We built an educational tool for beginner programmers wanting to sharpen up their array method knowledge in 3 programming languages (Javascript, Ruby and Python). The application is built with a react front-end and an express backend. Fully deployed on heroku here: https://hip-hip-array.herokuapp.com/ | Weeks 11 & 12 of Makers | React, Express, Heroku, Nodejs, Jest, Enzyme, Javascript, Ruby, Python | 
| :moneybag:[Bank Tech Test](https://github.com/bibicollins/Bank_tech_test) | Simulating a professional level tech test using Ruby to create a simple bank account that can print a summary of transactions in the console. The main focus of this week was to demonstrate my learning so far, especially focusing on TDD, OOD and writing code that is easy to read & change.  | Week 10 of Makers | Ruby, Rspec, Simplecov | 
| :umbrella:[Thermostat](https://github.com/bibicollins/thermostat) |  Entering the world of Javascript by creating a front-end thermostat web application.

This was also the first time using jQuery to build interactive functionality into a webpage.  | Week 5 of Makers | Javascript, Jasmine, Jquery | 
| :house:[Acebook](https://github.com/bibicollins/acebook-ruff-criminals) | Our first 2 week group project, designed to replicate a professional working environment, focusing heavily on using Agile process. | Weeks 8 & 9 of Makers | Ruby on Rails, Rspec, Capybara, Selenium and SimpleCov |


## Skills

#### Adaptability(?)
In July 2016 I moved to Spain to learn Spanish, naturally I had to work to earn my keep, so I studied a TEFL course and quickly got a job as an English teacher at an immersive language course. Despite having no previous experience of teaching I quickly had to adapt to the classroom whilst teaching predominantly business professionals in an intensive course.

#### Team work
I have always been a huge proponent of team work as it has been a central element in most of my work and life experience thus far. I was always part of sports teams at school, which I believe gives a good foundation for teamwork skills and further developed my teamwork skills working in the hospitality sector after school.
